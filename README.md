# Real-time Stop Monitor Module
Small python script to get arrival time of next bus/tram/train

## The End Goal...
... is to make a bed-side display (or smart mirror) that can display useful information to me. I've decided to start by breaking the code into smaller modules that output some certain information. Eventually I'll tie them all together. 

It is not intended that this will be useable by anybody else, but if you want to get it working for your own project or fix my problems, feel free!
